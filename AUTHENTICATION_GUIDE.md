## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Components Added**

4. Updated `components/Dashboard.tsx` - Added logout and greeting

### **Authentication Flow**

```
1. User visits website
2. Check if authenticated (localStorage)
3. If not authenticated → Show login screen
4. User enters password
5. Verify password ("Lesss Gooo")
6. If correct → Set authentication + redirect to dashboard
7. If incorrect → Show error message
8. User can logout anytime → Clear session
```

### **Storage Structure**

```javascript
localStorage.setItem("study_app_authenticated", "true");
localStorage.setItem("study_app_auth_time", Date.now().toString());
```

- Your password is: `Lesss Gooo` (exactly as written)
- Case-sensitive (capital L, space, capital G)
- No special characters or modifications needed

### **Session Duration**

- Session only lasts during current browser session
- Can manually logout anytime using the logout button
- Authentication cleared when page is refreshed or revisited

### **Browser Compatibility**
